--About the Project--

Since Microsoft released the Kinect, there are many hacks out there that try to use this new technology for commercial use, outside of just gaming.

We wanted to implement a shirt fitting store that utilizes the Kinect as an interaction device, and integrate with DCAPI for store catalog and checkout.

This is to also prove DCAPI's potential to integrate with various devices, using languages other than Javascript and Java.

--Technologies used--

Language - C# - since this is what the Kinect SDK uses

RestSharp - http://restsharp.org/ - a simple REST and HTTP API client for .NET

JSON.net - http://json.codeplex.com/ - JSON framework for .NET which allowed manual reading of JSON.

ZXing - http://code.google.com/p/zxing/ - QR code reading and writing for our customer login.

Kinect SDK v1.0 - http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/develop/developer-downloads.aspx - for Kinect control elements.
